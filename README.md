- Castling, checkmates, and other important rules.
- Human vs human and human vs AI game modes

- Artifitial Intelligence of this chess engine:
    - Minimax algorithm
    - Alpha-Beta pruning
    - Move ordering
    - Comprehensive evaluation function
    - Short, manually written, opening book
    - Memory of good moves found on previous positions (Including previous times that the program was executed!)


## Project
With more than 2000 lines of code, this is my largest project so far.
###
The code ended up being a little messy, and the engine has room to improve. Nonetheless, this was a very fun learning experience where I could deepen my knowledge of python, data structures and algorithms, and artifitial intelligence.
